I started working with her during a difficult period of deep depression, relying on food as a coping mechanism. With patience and understanding, she guided me in building a sustainable, healthy relationship with both fitness and nutrition. Our sessions are a safe space where I feel heard, supported, and uplifted. Shani’s judgment-free guidance and unwavering encouragement have truly transformed my life, empowering me to not only grow stronger physically but also heal emotionally. I am deeply grateful for her impact on my journey."

Even though I live in South Carolina, her virtual coaching gave me the structure, accountability, and motivation I needed. With her guidance, I not only stayed in shape but also improved my nutrition and built lasting healthy habits. Now, almost five years later, I’ve maintained a healthy weight and a balanced lifestyle. Finding Shani was truly a blessing, and I know she’ll continue to be a vital part of my wellness journey for years to come!"

Her holistic approach helped me overcome weight fluctuations, disordered eating, and the challenges of an undiagnosed autoimmune disease, all while navigating a demanding career. With her unwavering support, fitness and nutrition have become a fulfilling part of my lifestyle rather than a source of stress. More than transforming my body, Shani has helped me embrace self-acceptance and self-love. I not only look great—I feel even better. She was truly meant for this work, and I am endlessly grateful for her."

What I expected was a personal trainer; what I received was a true life coach who guided me through a 50lb. +  transformation—not just physically, but mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. Through her authentic and empathetic approach, Shani helped me navigate major life changes, from loss and relationships to career highs and lows, all while keeping my health at the center. Session after session, her coaching has been informed, impactful, and delivered in a way that resonates, challenges, and empowers. She is truly gifted, and the more women who experience the “Shani touch,” the better!"
